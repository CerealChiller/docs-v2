# Introduction

Yield Protocol brings fixed-rate borrowing and lending for fixed terms to decentralized finance.

Today, most of the popular decentralized finance protocols are floating-rate. While floating-rate lending and borrowing is a powerful tool, it comes with significant drawbacks. These protocols may experience interest rate volatility that can make it difficult for you to plan for the future, make investment decisions, and properly hedge risk when borrowing and lending. Yield Protocol solves these challenge by introducing fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending.

In this documentation, you can learn more about how the Yield Protocol works, how to get started, and how to learn more. 

<!-- TODO: maybe we can create a blog post outlining use cases and link it here -->

## About

Yield Protocol is an Ethereum-based protocol for collateralized fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending. 

To achieve its goals, Yield uses a class of tokens calledÂ *fyTokens* (fixed yield tokens). fyTokens are Ethereum based ERC-20 tokens that can be redeemed for an underlying asset one-to-one after a predetermined maturity date. For example, if you have one fyDai token, you can redeem it for one Dai after the maturity date.

  <img src="assets/mature.png" width="400" alt="fyDai at maturity" title="fyDai at maturity">
</figure>

fyTokens do not pay interest but instead trade at a discount to their redemption value (like a [zero-coupon bond](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp)), rendering a profit at maturity when it is redeemed for its full face value. The interest rate may be calculated from the difference between the discounted value and the underlying asset's value at maturity.

You can learn more about fyTokens by reading the original [Yield Protocol whitepaper](https://yield.is/Yield.pdf).

### An Example

Suppose you buy 1 fyDai that settles exactly a year from today for 0.95 Dai. Your yield is fixed because you have a fixed amount of invested capital (0.95 Dai) and a known amount of future return (1 Dai, a year from now).

A zero coupon bond's price is calculated by the following formula, where ***P*** is the price of the bond, ***M*** is the value of the underlying at maturity, ***r*** is the interest rate and ***n*** is the number of years to maturity.

$$ P = \frac{M}{(1 + r)^n} $$

Plugging our values in the formula and solving for r gives us our interest rate:

$$ 0.95 = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^1} \leftrightarrow r = \frac{1}{0.95} - 1 = 0.0526 $$

## Governance

Yield Protocol does not currently have a governance token. Currently, most of the maintenance and development of the protocol is performed by the founding development team. The development team is committed to making Yield Protocol a community-owned, community-run protocol by progressive decentralization. If you'd like to help shape the future of the protocol, please get involved by joining our [community](#Community).
