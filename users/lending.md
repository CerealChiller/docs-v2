# Lending

To lend at a fixed rate, you simply have to buy fyTokens from our YieldSpace AMM at a discount.

The discount you receive from the face value of the fyToken locks in a fixed return that can be calculated based on the time to maturity.

For example, if on September 31, 2021, you buy 100 fyDai that matures in December 2021 for 98.8 Dai you will earn an implied rate of interest of 5% APR.

fyTokens can be held until the maturity date, upon which they may be redeemed for principal plus interest.

You can also exit your lending position early by selling your fyToken for an underlying asset. Because fyTokens are traded freely, changes in interest rates may affect the amount of underlying assets you receive when redeeming early.

To compensate lenders who do not redeem fyTokens right away, after maturity they begin earning interest in the form of an increasing redemption rate.

 <!-- TODO: need to expand more as how interest paid will be calculated after maturity. -->

#### Maturity

If you own fyDai after maturity, you will start to earn the Dai Savings Rate on your fyDai, until you decide to redeem it for Dai.
