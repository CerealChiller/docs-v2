You may begin using Yield Protocol by visitingÂ the frontend at [https://app.yield.is](https://app.yield.is/).

Using Yield Protocol, you can borrow or lend assets at a fixed rate for a fixed term. You may also provide liquidity the Yield Protocol to earn fees from other users looking to borrow and lend.

At the core of Yield Protocol are user-owned vaults representing a collateralized debt position. Each vault is associated with single collateral and debt in a single series.

A series represents a single borrowable asset with a defined maturity date. Each series corresponds to a single ERC-20 fyToken. For example, Alice may own a vault with ETH collateral and debt in the USDC092521 series. The USDC092521 series represents an obligation to repay USDC on September 25th, 2021.
