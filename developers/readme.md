## Developer Documentation

The Yield App is available atÂ [https://app.yield.is](https://app.yield.is/).

Using the Yield App, you can borrow or lend assets at a fixed rate for a fixed term. You may also use the Yield app to provide liquidity to earn fees from other users looking to borrow and lend.

At the core of Yield are user-owned vaults representing a collateralized debt position. Each vault is associated with single collateral and debt in a single series.

A series represents a single borrowable asset with a defined maturity date. Each series corresponds to a single ERC-20 fyToken. For example, Alice may own a vault with ETH collateral and debt in the USDC0925 series. The USDC0925 series represents an obligation to repay USDC on September 25th, 2021.
