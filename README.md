# Introduction

Yield brings fixed-term, fixed-rate borrowing and lending to decentralized finance.

Today most of the popular decentralized finance protocols are floating-rate. While floating-rate lending and borrowing is a powerful tool, it comes with significant drawbacks. These protocols may experience interest rate volatility that can make it difficult for you to plan for the future, make investment decisions, and properly hedge risk when borrowing and lending. Decentralized finance has several use cases that can be greatly improved with fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending.

<!-- TODO: maybe we can create a blog post outlining use cases and link it here -->

To enable fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending, Yield uses a class of tokens calledÂ *fyTokens(fixed yield tokens)*. fyTokens are Ethereum based ERC-20 tokens that can be redeemed for an underlying asset one-to-one after a predetermined maturity date. For example, if you have one fyDai token, you can redeem it for one Dai after the maturity date.

fyTokens are analogous to [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp) in the sense that they do not pay interest but instead trade at a discount, rendering a profit at maturity when it is redeemed for its full face value. The interest rate is calculated by the difference between the discounted value and the underlying asset's value at maturity.

### An Example

Suppose you buy 1 fyDai that settles exactly a year from today for 0.95 Dai. Your yield is fixed because you have a fixed amount of invested capital (0.95 Dai) and a known amount of future return (1 Dai, a year from now).

A zero coupon bond's price is calculated by the following formula, where ***P*** is the price of the bond, ***M*** is the value of the underlying at maturity, ***r*** is the interest rate and ***n*** is the number of years to maturity.

$$ P = \frac{M}{(1 + r)^n} $$

Plugging our values in the formula and solving for r gives us our interest rate:

$$ 0.95 = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^1} \leftrightarrow r = \frac{1}{0.95} - 1 = 0.0526 $$
